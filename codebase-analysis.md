    GoogleAI -- Output: Scene Descriptions --> GenerateStoryboard
    
    GenerateScenes -- Input: Descriptions + Style --> GoogleAI
    GoogleAI -- Output: Images --> GenerateScenes
```

### State Management Approach

The application uses Zustand for state management, with a primary focus on project data:

```mermaid

## Software Developer Perspective

### Code Organization and Project Structure

The codebase follows a well-organized structure typical of Next.js applications:

- `/src`: Main source code directory
  - `/app`: Next.js app router pages
  - `/components`: UI components
    - `/ui`: Base UI components
    - `/app`: Application-specific components
  - `/ai`: AI integration code
    - `/flows`: AI workflow definitions
  - `/lib`: Utility functions and types
  - `/stores`: Zustand stores
  - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks

### Key Components and Their Responsibilities

#### Pages

- `page.tsx` (Home): Entry point for creating new projects
- `library/page.tsx`: Displays all user projects
- `project/[projectId]/page.tsx`: Project details with tabs for different stages

#### AI Flows

- `analyze-story.ts`: Analyzes story text to extract themes, characters, structure, and summary
- `generate-storyboard.ts`: Creates scene descriptions based on story analysis
- `generate-scenes.ts`: Generates images for each scene description using the selected visual style

#### Components

- `StoryInputForm.tsx`: Form for inputting story title and text
- `ProjectCard.tsx`: Card displaying project information in the library
- `AnalysisTabContent.tsx`: Displays story analysis results
- `StoryboardTabContent.tsx`: Manages storyboard generation and scene creation
- `VideoTabContent.tsx`: Handles video compilation from generated scenes

### AI Integration Implementation

The AI integration is implemented using Genkit, which provides a structured way to define AI flows:

1. **Schema Definition**: Each AI flow defines input and output schemas using Zod
2. **Prompt Definition**: Prompts are defined with specific instructions for the AI
3. **Flow Implementation**: The flow connects the input, prompt, and output processing

Example from `analyze-story.ts`:

```typescript
const analyzeStoryPrompt = ai.definePrompt({
  name: 'analyzeStoryPrompt',
  input: {schema: AnalyzeStoryInputSchema},
  output: {schema: AnalyzeStoryOutputSchema},
  prompt: `You are a literary expert. Analyze the provided story and identify key themes, main characters, story structure, and provide a summary.

Story:
{{storyText}}`,
});

const analyzeStoryFlow = ai.defineFlow(
  {
    name: 'analyzeStoryFlow',
    inputSchema: AnalyzeStoryInputSchema,
    outputSchema: AnalyzeStoryOutputSchema,
  },
  async input => {
    const {output} = await analyzeStoryPrompt(input);
    return output!;
  }
);
```

### Firebase Integration

Firebase is used for data storage and retrieval:

1. **Configuration**: Firebase is initialized in `firebase-config.ts`
2. **Service Functions**: CRUD operations are defined in `firestore-service.ts`
3. **Data Model**: The project data structure is defined in `types.ts`

The application uses Firestore for storing project data, with a collection for projects and documents for each project.

### UI Component Library

The application uses a combination of Radix UI primitives and custom components styled with Tailwind CSS:

1. **Base Components**: Button, Card, Dialog, etc. from Radix UI
2. **Custom Components**: ProjectCard, SceneCard, etc. built on top of base components
3. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design and theming

### Reusable Patterns and Utilities

Several reusable patterns are employed throughout the codebase:

1. **Custom Hooks**: `use-toast.ts`, `use-theme.ts`, etc.
2. **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive type definitions in `types.ts`
3. **Utility Functions**: Helper functions in `utils.ts`
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns in API calls and AI interactions

### Development Workflow

The development workflow is supported by several scripts in `package.json`:

- `dev`: Runs the Next.js development server
- `genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server
- `build`: Builds the production application
- `typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking
